# TODO: Scaling for DB

# DB Indexes	Add indexes on ts, latitude, longitude, family_id, and herd_id
# Async Routes	Use FastAPI's async def and asyncpg with PostgreSQL
# Partitioning - Partition by time (e.g., monthly) or by herd_id (speciies name) or location (country/region)


# ðŸ”¹ TimescaleDB:
# Use time_bucket for grouping time-series data (e.g., hourly/daily averages).

# Use continuous aggregates for performant dashboards.

# Apply compression and retention policies automatically.

# ðŸ”¹ PostGIS:
# Use ST_DWithin, ST_Intersects, etc., to filter by geographic distance or region.

# Use spatial indexes (GIST) to speed up these queries.
